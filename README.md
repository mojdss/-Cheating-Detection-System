# üìö Cheating Detection System

## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **automated cheating detection system** using **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **behavioral analysis** techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious activities during exams or assessments, such as:
- Copying from neighbors
- Using unauthorized devices
- Looking away from the screen
- Sharing answers via communication tools

The system can be deployed in various settings, including:
- Online proctoring platforms
- Physical exam halls with surveillance cameras
- Remote learning environments

By leveraging AI and real-time monitoring, this system aims to enhance academic integrity and reduce instances of cheating.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Detect Suspicious Behavior**: Identify actions that indicate cheating, such as looking around, using mobile phones, or sharing screens.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Analyze video feeds in real-time to flag potential cheating incidents.
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Use machine learning models to classify normal vs. suspicious behavior.
4. **Alert Notifications**: Trigger alerts when cheating is detected.
5. **Audit Logs**: Maintain records of flagged incidents for review by administrators.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and object detection
- **YOLOv8 / MobileNet SSD**: For detecting objects like mobile phones, papers, etc.
- **DeepSORT / SORT**: For tracking individuals across frames
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For training custom models
- **Flask / FastAPI**: For building APIs or web interfaces
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualization
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment

## üìÅ Dataset

### Sources:
1. **Synthetic Data**: Simulate cheating scenarios using actors or animations.
2. **Public Datasets**:
   - [UCF Crime Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/ucfcrime/)
   - [CASIA B Dataset](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/scliao/projects/ASL/)
   - Custom datasets annotated with cheating behaviors.

### Files:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cheating_videos/train/` | Videos labeled with cheating behavior |
| `cheating_videos/test/` | Test videos for evaluation |
| `annotations/` | JSON files containing bounding boxes and labels |

## üî¨ Methodology

### Step 1: Data Collection & Annotation

- Record videos of students taking exams under controlled conditions.
- Label frames with annotations for:
  - Cheating actions (e.g., copying, using phones).
  - Normal behavior (e.g., writing, reading).

### Step 2: Preprocessing

- Normalize video resolution and frame rate.
- Split videos into individual frames for labeling and training.

### Step 3: Object Detection

- Train a model (e.g., YOLOv8) to detect objects like:
  - Mobile phones
  - Papers or notes
  - Unauthorized devices

### Step 4: Behavioral Analysis

- Use **pose estimation** to track head movements and gaze direction.
- Apply **activity recognition** to classify actions like:
  - Looking around
  - Writing
  - Interacting with devices

### Step 5: Real-Time Monitoring

- Deploy the model to analyze live video streams.
- Track individuals using DeepSORT or SORT.
- Flag suspicious behavior based on predefined thresholds.

### Step 6: Alert System

- Send notifications to proctors or administrators when cheating is detected.
- Log incidents for review.

## üöÄ Future Work

1. **Multi-Camera Support**: Extend the system to handle multiple camera feeds simultaneously.
2. **Audio Analysis**: Incorporate audio cues (e.g., whispering) to detect cheating.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Use unsupervised learning to identify unusual patterns.
4. **Integration with Proctoring Platforms**: Deploy as a plugin for existing online assessment tools.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure privacy compliance and minimize false positives.
